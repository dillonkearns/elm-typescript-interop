Could not parse file `src/Main.elm` at position 32. Errors:
expected end of input

There are some parsing bugs for the Elm AST library I use.
Try reproducing the parse error by pasting it into:
https://tunguski.github.io/elm-ast/example/.

See this issue for a new Elm syntax parsing library that's being explored to fix some of these bugs: https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-typescript-interop/issues/17.
